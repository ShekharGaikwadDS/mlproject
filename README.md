## Machine Learning Project: This is a project aimed at building a machine learning model for a specific use case. The project involves setting up the code on GitHub, defining a project structure, and implementing logging and exception handling. EDA and model training will be performed to build a robust model that will be used for making predictions. The project also includes data ingestion and transformation, and the creation of a model train-predict pipeline. The ultimate goal of the project is to deploy the trained model. This project uses Python and various machine learning libraries. Contributions are welcome
